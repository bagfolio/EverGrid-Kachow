Your current upload interface is clean and functional, but there are several improvements we could make to enhance user experience, increase completion rates, and make the process more intuitive. Here are my recommendations:
1. Structural Improvements
Add Progress Indicator

Add a step indicator at the top showing where this upload step fits within the overall assessment process (e.g., "Step 2 of 4: Documentation Upload")
Include a visual progress bar showing percentage complete of the entire compliance process

Enhance Navigation

Add "Back" and "Continue" buttons at the bottom to help users navigate through the assessment flow
Include a "Save & Continue Later" option since gathering these documents might require time

2. Utility Bill Upload Enhancements
Add Educational Elements

Include a sample utility bill image with key areas highlighted to show users exactly what to look for
Add tooltips explaining which specific information will be extracted (e.g., rate structure, peak demand, usage history)

Improve User Confidence

Add a "Processing Preview" that appears after upload, showing the document with key data points that were successfully extracted
Include a success message with specifics: "Great! We identified your monthly usage of X kWh and peak demand of Y kW"

Alternative Entry Options

Add a "Connect directly to utility provider" option with logos of supported utilities
Include a manual entry fallback: "Don't have your bill? Enter basic information manually"

3. Facility Photos Improvements
Add Visual Guidance

Include example photos next to each upload area showing what a good electrical meter/panel photo looks like
Add clear photography tips: "Ensure all labels are visible" and "Take photos in good lighting"

Expand Photo Categories

Add a third photo category for "Potential Installation Area" to help with space planning
Include an optional "Building Exterior" photo category

Add AI-Assisted Feedback

Implement real-time feedback on photo quality: "We can see your meter clearly" or "Please retake with less glare"
Add visual markers highlighting important elements detected in the photos

4. General UX Improvements
Enhanced Visual Design

Use more distinct visual styling for the drag-drop areas (perhaps subtle animation on hover)
Incorporate progress animations during upload and processing
Consider a more vibrant color for action buttons to increase visibility

Add Contextual Help

Add "Why we need this" expandable sections explaining how each document helps compliance
Include FAQ toggles addressing common concerns (e.g., "Is my utility data secure?")

Mobile Optimization

Add direct camera access on mobile devices
Implement mobile-specific cropping guidance for photos

5. Post-Upload Experience
Confirmation and Next Steps

Add clear confirmation when all uploads are complete
Show a "What happens next" section explaining the analysis process
Include an estimated timeline: "We'll analyze your uploads within 24 hours"

Value Preview

Add a teaser of insights they'll gain: "Your utility data will help us identify potential savings of X−X-
X−Y annually"


Task Completion Reinforcement

Add gamification elements like completion badges or checkmarks
Include positive reinforcement messaging: "Great job! You're making excellent progress toward compliance"

7. Risk Intelligence Integration
For integrating ArcGIS risk data to check against SNF addresses:
Data Sources & Integration

PSPS (Public Safety Power Shutoff) zone data from utilities
CAL FIRE hazard severity zones
USGS earthquake risk data
Historical outage records from CPUC
FEMA flood zone data

Implementation Approach

Use address geocoding to convert facility addresses to lat/long coordinates
Perform spatial queries against risk zone polygons
Calculate proximity to hazard boundaries (how close to a fire zone, etc.)
Create composite risk score based on multiple factors
Store results in facility risk profile
Set up recurring updates to reflect changing conditions (seasonal fire risk, etc.)

Automated Alerting

Real-time notifications when facilities enter high-risk situations
Weather event tracking with impact forecasting
Escalation protocols based on risk severity
Integration with emergency response planning

1. Welcome Screen
Design a welcoming entry point featuring:

Mobile Lightning logo prominently displayed at the top
An animated battery/lightning icon that softly pulses
Headline: "Power Solutions Made Simple"
Subheading: "Complete this quick assessment to discover your tailored microgrid solution"
Large, prominent "Get Started" button with subtle hover effect
Optional "Learn More" link for users who want additional information before starting

2. Initial Contact Information
Create a form collecting essential user information:

Clean, single-column layout with generously spaced form fields
Organization name field with autocomplete for known companies
Contact name field (first and last name)
Business email with validation (business domain checking)
Phone number with formatting mask as user types
Role/title dropdown (Facility Manager, Operations Director, Energy Manager, Sustainability Lead, Other)
"Continue" button only activates when required fields are completed
Subtle field validation with green checkmarks appearing when fields are properly filled

3. Facility Type Selection
Design an intuitive facility type selector:

Visual card-based selection (not just a dropdown) with 5-6 cards in a grid
Each card should include:

Icon representing the facility type (healthcare icon, data center servers, etc.)
Facility type name as header (Skilled Nursing Facility, Hospital, Data Center, Port Operation, Industrial Manufacturing, Other)
Brief description (1-2 lines) of typical needs for that facility type


Cards highlight/elevate when hovered and show selected state when clicked
If "Skilled Nursing Facility" is selected, display brief message about AB 2511 compliance
If "Other" is selected, show an additional field for specifying the facility type
"Continue" button appears more prominent after selection is made

4. Facility Identification & Address
Create an intelligent address entry system:

Start with a search field labeled "Find your facility"
As user types, present a dropdown of matching facilities from the CSV file
Each dropdown result should show:

Facility name
Address
City/State
Facility ID (smaller text, for reference)


When user selects a match, auto-populate all relevant fields including:

Full address (street, city, state, zip)
Known bed count (for healthcare facilities)
FACADMIN and contact information if available


If no match is found, smoothly transition to manual entry mode
Include a small map preview that shows the location pin after selection
Add "Is this information correct?" confirmation with edit option

5. Utility Information Collection
Design a dual-path utility data collection:

Present two clear options with visual cards:

"Connect Your Utility Account" (primary recommendation)
"Upload Utility Bill" (alternative option)


For the Connect option:

Show logos of supported utilities (PG&E, SCE, SDG&E, etc.)
When selected, display a secure OAuth-style connection popup
Include reassuring security message: "We use bank-level encryption and never store your utility credentials"
Show animated connecting/loading state during the process
Display success confirmation with green checkmark when connected


For the Upload option:

Provide a drag-and-drop zone with dotted border
Include clear instructions: "Drag your most recent utility bill (PDF or image)"
Show supported file types (PDF, JPG, PNG)
Display upload progress bar during file transmission
Preview the document after upload with option to replace


Allow users to skip this step with "I'll do this later" option, but include gentle messaging about the benefits of providing utility data now

6. Site Assessment Photos
Create an intuitive photo collection interface:

Explain purpose: "These photos help us assess your electrical infrastructure for compatibility"
Show 3 photo collection categories with visual examples:

Electrical Panel (example thumbnail showing what we're looking for)
Transformer/Electrical Room (example thumbnail)
Potential Installation Area (example thumbnail)


For each category, provide:

Simple drag-drop upload zone
Direct camera access button for mobile users
Text guidance on what should be visible in the photo
Warning if uploaded image is too dark/blurry


Make this step optional with "Skip for now" button
Show progress indicators for uploads and processing status
Include helper text explaining that photos can be added later if skipped

7. Confirmation & Next Steps
Design a completion screen that:

Shows a celebratory animation (subtle confetti or checkmark effect)
Displays a "Profile Created Successfully!" message
Summarizes the information collected
Shows the next steps in the process with estimated times:

"Our team is analyzing your information (1-2 business days)"
"You'll receive your personalized assessment via email"
"A Mobile Lightning expert will contact you to discuss your solution"


Provides immediate access to dashboard with "Go to Dashboard" button
Offers option to "Add another facility" for multi-site organizations

Special Interaction Features
Throughout the process, implement these user-friendly features:

Persistent Save: Autosave progress as users move through steps
Step Navigation: Allow jumping between completed steps from the progress bar
Help Tooltips: Small question mark icons that reveal contextual help when clicked
Keyboard Navigation: Full tab navigation and enter key submission
Loading States: Subtle animations during processing to indicate activity
Error Recovery: Friendly error messages with clear recovery paths
Exit Protection: Confirmation dialog if user attempts to leave with unsaved data
Responsive Breakpoints: Optimized layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile

This sign-up process balances comprehensive data collection with user-friendly interactions, creating an elegant experience that reduces friction and increases completion rates. The design emphasizes visual clarity and progressive disclosure to make the technical assessment process approachable for all facility managers.

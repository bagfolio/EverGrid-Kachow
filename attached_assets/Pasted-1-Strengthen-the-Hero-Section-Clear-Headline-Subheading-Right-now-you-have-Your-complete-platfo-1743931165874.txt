1. Strengthen the Hero Section
Clear Headline & Subheading
Right now, you have “Your complete platform for AB 2511 compliance…” and a mention of the compliance deadline. Consider using a bolder, more concise headline and a quick subheading that captures the unique value proposition. For example:

“Effortless AB 2511 Compliance. Reliable Backup Power Solutions.”
“Meet your 2026 deadline with confidence and streamline energy management.”

Prominent Call to Action (CTA)
Instead of only highlighting the date, add a clear, single CTA button (e.g., “Get Started” or “Learn More”) at the top so users know exactly where to go next.

Visual Interest
Incorporate an engaging hero image or illustration relevant to compliance/energy solutions (like a facility with power backup, or a simple icon-based graphic). This helps convey the platform’s purpose at a glance.

2. Clarify “How EverGrid Works”
Use a Step-by-Step or Timeline Layout
Visually represent each step (Assess → Plan → Implement) with icons or a short description below each. This makes it easier to skim.

Assess: Brief bullet (e.g., “Evaluate your facility’s power needs.”)

Plan: Brief bullet (e.g., “Design a customized microgrid solution.”)

Implement: Brief bullet (e.g., “Deploy and monitor for continuous compliance.”)

Add a Simple Graphic or Numbering
Use a 3-column layout with an icon above each step to break up text and make it more memorable.

3. Improve the Portal Cards Layout
You have two distinct user flows: “Facility Portal” and “Admin Portal.” Right now, they are side-by-side blocks with bullet points.

Use Clear, Distinct Cards or Panels
Give each portal a card-style design with a slight shadow or a subtle background color difference. This visually separates them and makes it clear they are different entry points.

Add Simple Icons for Each Feature
For “Compliance Dashboard,” “Energy Reports,” etc., small icons next to each bullet can help users quickly scan the functionality.

Make the Buttons More Prominent

Primary CTA Button: “Enter as Facility Staff” or “Enter as Administrator”

Secondary CTA Link or Button: “New Registration” or “Create Admin Account”

The primary button could be more prominent (e.g., filled in with your main brand color) and the secondary could be a text or outline button.

4. Refine the Top Bar / Header
Logo & Navigation
If you have additional pages (e.g., “Features,” “Pricing,” “Contact”), consider adding them to a top navigation bar. If it’s just a single-page design, a minimal header with the logo and a single “Sign In” or “Register” button is enough.

Sticky Header
A sticky header can be helpful so users can always access the main CTA or login/register button.

5. Showcase Social Proof & Deadline Urgency
Highlight the 350+ SNFs
You mention “Already helping 350+ SNFs achieve compliance.” Turn that into a quick testimonial section or a stats bar to reinforce credibility.

“Trusted by over 350 Skilled Nursing Facilities.”

Deadline Reminder
Use a small banner or a subtle countdown to remind users that the AB 2511 compliance deadline is approaching. This can be a banner below the hero or a small alert at the top of the page.

6. Consider Overall Visual Hierarchy & Branding
Color Palette
The purple/lavender is distinctive. Ensure you use it consistently for buttons and key highlights. Keep secondary colors neutral or complementary (e.g., light grays, off-whites) so the purple stands out.

Typography

Use a larger, bolder font for headlines (e.g., 28px–32px).

Keep subheadings around 20px–24px.

Body text 14px–16px for readability.

Maintain consistent line spacing and weights.

White Space
Increase padding and margins around sections. Let the design “breathe.” This makes everything feel cleaner and more professional.

7. Add a Quick “How to Get Started” or Onboarding Section
1–2–3 Steps
After explaining how EverGrid works, guide new users through the actual sign-up or login process. For instance:

Create an account.

Enter facility details.

Launch compliance dashboard.

Progress Indicators
If the registration or onboarding is multi-step, show progress bars or steps (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.) to reduce user friction.

8. Make It Mobile-Responsive
Responsive Layout
On smaller screens, stack the “Facility Portal” and “Admin Portal” cards. Ensure text wraps nicely and that buttons remain large enough to tap comfortably.

Test on Real Devices
Ensure the hero section text, headings, and CTAs still look good on mobile (no overlapping or tiny text).

9. Incorporate a Short Video or Animation (Optional)
Explainer Video
A 30–60 second clip can quickly convey how the platform solves compliance challenges. This is especially helpful for complex concepts like microgrids or compliance processes.

Animated Illustrations
Subtle animations in the “How It Works” section can grab attention without overwhelming the user.

10. Offer Clear Next Steps
Single Main CTA
If your main goal is to get facilities to sign up, the entire page should drive toward that action. Use phrasing like:

“Ready to ensure compliance? Create an account in minutes.”
